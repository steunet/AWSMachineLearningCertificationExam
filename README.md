# AWS Machine Learning Certification Exam Materials
This repository contains Materials for preparing aws machine learning certification exam created by me, using different sources, based on the official exam guide (https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/machinelearning/AWS%20Certified%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Specialty_Exam%20Guide_v1.1_FINAL.pdf).

Some other references used:
- https://medium.com/@julsimon/thoughts-on-the-beta-machine-learning-certification-869a5a469597
- AWS docs and blogs (very sparse)



I am writing it as exercise to prepare for the exam and  I will maintain it till my exam date

Hope it will be useful for other students too
